# **Unreal Engine 4**

Unreal Engine 4 (UE4) is one of the most advanced game engines out there going head to head with Unity all the time. You want better graphics? Use UE4. Simple as that.

### Installation

The best way to install UE4 is to simply follow the documentation on their site. It guarantees 100% success every single time, plus there is a link to a very vibrant community and forum that will help you overcome issues, if any.

### Basics

There are two ways you can go about learning UE4.

1. Learning game development using Blueprints: Blueprints is a very popular feature in Unreal Engine and it enables creation of games using simple blocks and flowcharts. Almost all the functionalities of UE4 can be accomplished using blueprints and considering the level where it is right now, it is one of the easiest and most powerful ways to make games. It is nearly equivalent to scripting in C++.

2. Learning game development using C++ C++ is one of the most powerful languages out there and one of the most popular for game development. Scripting in C++ allows you to have a certain level of control over your game that blueprints simply cannot offer.

I'd recommend everyone to explore the resources provided by the creators, the [GameDev.tv](http://gamedev.tv) Team. They have a discord channel with an amazing community of people ready to help you.
